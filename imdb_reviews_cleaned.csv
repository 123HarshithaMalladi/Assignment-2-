"ArgylleA very hyped movie from the writer of the Kingsman series, the trailer frequently showed moments of silliness, spy action, Bryce Dallas Howard screaming and a cat that's supposedly awesome or something. At first the movie is cheesy as can be, but it does appear that is intentional. Most of the movie leads the audience to believe it is one thing, when it really is another, being revealed in surprise twists that aren't very surprising.The ensemble cast does feature some great performances, even though Henry Cavill's hair is absolutely terrible. Dua Lipa's appearance is short, but she does a great job that it made me miss seeing her. Sam Rockwell continues a trend in Hollywood where age can be defied as I forgot he is in his mid 50s following the likes of Tom Cruise and Jason Statham.The movie is way too long and needed a better editor. I like a fleshed out story as much as the next person, but calm down movie.Now, on to the fun. This movie makes the word ""ridiculous"" woefully inadequate. But it's a fun ridiculous. There are so many laugh out loud moments that it makes up for a lot of the flaws. I don't want to spoil the movie, but keep an eye out for the blink and you'll miss it hilarity.There are themes explored in this film about motivation, and whether the emotions experienced during life's choices, even when told in the format of a spy thriller, would carry over if you got to do it all over again. Personally, I find that theory worth exploring, because I wonder if I'd make the same good or bad decisions if not exposed to certain stimuli or experiences. Nature vs nurture anyone? People admit that they would love to be able to speak to their younger selves to assure them that things would be better eventually, or to avoid pitfalls, but that's not good enough. One never knows if that would make any difference, unless you take away those moments.I enjoyed the heck out of this movie overall, and recommend it for the silliness alone. Don't take the movie seriously, and I believe you will too. The entire, very long, ending sequence is just crazy with the suspension of disbelief, but embrace it.",argyllea hype movi writer kingsman seri trailer frequent show moment silli spi action bryce dalla howard scream cat that supposedli awesom someth first movi cheesi appear intent movi lead audienc believ one thing realli anoth reveal surpris twist arent surprisingth ensembl cast featur great perform even though henri cavil hair absolut terribl dua lipa appear short great job made miss see sam rockwel continu trend hollywood age defi forgot mid follow like tom cruis jason stathamth movi way long need better editor like flesh stori much next person calm movienow fun movi make word ridicul woefulli inadequ fun ridicul mani laugh loud moment make lot flaw dont want spoil movi keep eye blink youll miss hilarityther theme explor film motiv whether emot experienc life choic even told format spi thriller would carri got person find theori worth explor wonder id make good bad decis expo certain stimulus experi natur v nurtur anyon peopl admit would love abl speak younger selv assur thing would better eventu avoid pitfal that good enough one never know would make differ unless take away momentsi enjoy heck movi overal recommend silli alon dont take movi serious believ entir long end sequenc crazi suspens disbelief embrac
"There are some movies to which you give 6 or 5 points. But you enjoy the film and find it entertaining. This is one of those films. The movie is extremely entertaining. I had a great time at the cinema. Yes, the effects in the film are terrible; yes, it is a parody; and yes, it is ridiculous. However, it was also absurdly funny and silly. I enjoyed it very much. As a movie, I believe it is average, but not bad. Of course, there are numerous clich√©s in the film. Many things could have been predicted. By the way, the film is a total twist show. Twists occur one after another, just like in spy films. I lost the seriousness of the movie in the first half hour of the movie. I started enjoying it. The acting isn't perfect, but I think it's spot-on for this movie. I have never seen Bryce Dallas Howard in this kind of role before. It suits her. They also made a great duo with Sam Rockwell. The action scenes in the movie are like those in the ""Kingsman"" movies, and the director is Matthew Vaughn, who directed those movies too. I didn't fully understand the mid-credit scene of the movie, but if the second movie comes out, I will definitely go. I have no objection to this movie being a series. One of the reasons I like the movie so much is the cat. Alfie, the cat, has many roles in the movie. I don't know which scenes were real and which scenes were CGI (a few were definitely CGI), but it was very funny and entertaining.",movi give point enjoy film find entertain one film movi extrem entertain great time cinema ye effect film terribl ye parodi ye ridicul howev also absurdli funni silli enjoy much movi believ averag bad cours numer clich film mani thing could predict way film total twist show twist occur one anoth like spi film lost serious movi first half hour movi start enjoy act isnt perfect think spoton movi never seen bryce dalla howard kind role suit also made great duo sam rockwel action scene movi like kingsman movi director matthew vaughn direct movi didnt fulli understand midcredit scene movi second movi come definit go object movi seri one reason like movi much cat alfi cat mani role movi dont know scene real scene cgi definit cgi funni entertain
"Have you ever watched a movie thats so absurd and brainless that it actually works? Argylle belongs to that group - as Matthew Vaughns latest is gladly a crowd-pleasing action flick that is full of smart twists and epic action sequences. There's no doubt that it does get ridicule at times, with huge logic gaps and absurdity - but this movie embraces its silliness, dedicating its writing to plot-twists that are so well thought out that you would never guess them coming - making Argylle an action movie that stands out enough to be enjoyable.When the movie started rolling, I at first couldn't get invested in its storyline. The narrative seemed generic andd full of irrefutable plot holes. However, I remembered Matthew Vaughns genius. What he sold us in Kick Ass and Kingsman were ridiculously entertaining and thoughtful action flicks, and I had hope Argylle was going to turn in to the same - and boy, it did. The best aspect of this movie is, no doubt, its incredible and provocative plot-twists which really add this sense of unpredictability to this film and keeps you smiling always. These really start to kick off from the half-hour mark - whenever you predict whats about to happen, we get the total opposite - and there's clever hints skillfully layered around foreshadowing and setting up these twists to make you smile when they happen. It's definitely arguable from another perspective that they aren't justified enough, as they do question more potential plot holes - however this is what adds to the unpredictability and distinct nature of this movieThe ensemble cast also just adds to the fun. Everyone does a great job, but Sam Rockwell's character is the most entertaining and easiest to root for.This fun isn't without its issues, though - as its main one is its lack of any emotion or layers within our characters. They are often unconvincing and bland, with the only form of character dynamics coming from our protagonist and their partner in crime. Apart from that though, we have no reason to care for our characters, any of them in particular. The CGI is often horrific at times too. It shows its decency in some fight-scenes, but in others it is truly appalling.Ultimately, and despite the movies issues, Argylle and It's absurd plot (that I don't want to talk about as there are just too many twists!) will keep all audiences engaged, purely thanks to Vaughn and the writing teams genius plot-twists that make this movie one to definitely check out, standing out from the hoard of movies in its genre. And thats just what we need from it, especially in this day and age where politics and global issues distract us from having a good time!",ever watch movi that absurd brainless actual work argyl belong group matthew vaughn latest gladli crowdpleas action flick full smart twist epic action sequenc there doubt get ridicul time huge logic gap absurd movi embrac silli dedic write plottwist well thought would never guess come make argyl action movi stand enough enjoyablewhen movi start roll first couldnt get invest storylin narr seem gener andd full irrefut plot hole howev rememb matthew vaughn geniu sold u kick as kingsman ridicul entertain thought action flick hope argyl go turn boy best aspect movi doubt incred provoc plottwist realli add sen unpredict film keep smile alway realli start kick halfhour mark whenev predict what happen get total opposit there clever hint skill layer around foreshadow set twist make smile happen definit arguabl anoth perspect arent justifi enough question potenti plot hole howev add unpredict distinct natur movieth ensembl cast also add fun everyon great job sam rockwel charact entertain easiest root forthi fun isnt without issu though main one lack emot layer within charact often unconvinc bland form charact dynam come protagonist partner crime apart though reason care charact particular cgi often horrif time show decenc fightscen other truli appallingultim despit movi issu argyl absurd plot dont want talk mani twist keep audienc engag pure thank vaughn write team geniu plottwist make movi one definit check stand hoard movi genr that need especi day age polit global issu distract u good time
"I saw this title at an advance screening and just took my SO to check it out before any spoilers got to him. Is it perfect? No, what is? Is it fun? YES!!I don't know where we went off the rails as an audience that we get more enjoyment in dumping on everything than just sitting back and taking in something lighthearted and fun. I went in expecting some kind of Romancing the Stone / 2022's Lost City style story and was instead zig-zagged through countless twists that others have criticized as one-too-many, but I felt were just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Yes, it ran a tad bit long, but I can't imagine what I would relegate to the cutting room floor.It's full of twists and turns, beautiful and original fight sequences, and romance. Like Aidan says at some point in regards to Elly's writing - we don't need another Sense and Sensibility (or something to that degree). If you're looking for a fun trip, have enjoyed Vaugh's style previously, and don't have a stick up your tush/can't stand seeing a powerful woman - go see it and have fun. Haters? Take your misery somewhere else already <3.8.5/10

"LIKES:Humor
-I enjoyed a lot of the comedy in this movie, despite how cheeky and over the top it can be sometime.-Argylle uses a lot of tactics to get a laugh, including: sarcasm, straight up delivery, unbelievable stunts, cheesy moments, and some slapstick that helps go with the flow of the Vaughn movie.-Balanced into a surprising degree, it doesn't go too farfetched for viewers like me and helps blend that comic book quality with real life that meshes well for me and keeps the movie in that fun area that the first two Kingsman did well.Music
-Absolutely one of my favorite elements, Vaughn's group has helped pull the right tracks together that are used so intelligently to accomplish a lot of things.-Sometimes the song is just funny, that perfect touch to go with the theme, sell the thoughts, and add that background noise that hits scene by scene in the sequence to bring everything together
-Other times, the song is just catchy, very energetic, upbeat, and with the sound effects, that culmination of sound engineering that gets me pumped to find the right song.-It's dynamic, it's quirky, and it really just has the Vaughn feeling behind it that I've loved in most of the spy ring craziness.The Fun
-Like Kingsman movies 1 and 2, the movie for me was just fun.-It didn't get too caught up in the politics and agendas of the world, but went back to that ludicrous story that blended many elements together into an engaging piece that kept my attention.-And yet, still has a story that helps ground it and lead to a more well-rounded experience that avoids (mostly) getting caught up on an element or gimmick to bash it into paste.The Story:
-I won't say it's the best, but the movie still holds candor for elevating the film past just knock off jokes and violent punches.-Argylle's story actually gives some character development in two of the title characters, helping focus on the story elements and less on the power player role that I very much enjoyed.-A little bit of world building, alongside some engaging elements really gave me characters to follow, and upped the stakes a bit to help accomplish much in the short time period.The Action To Some Degree
-Vaughn knows how to make memorable action sequences and this movie still shows his creative elements coming to life.-The early stuff surprisingly is grounded, a bit more traditional outside of a few stunts that scream Rockwell fervor.-Near the end though, most of the bouts are totally in the comic book aspect, over the top, flashy, funny, and downright corny that I couldn't help but love everything coming together.-If that's not your element, chances are this movie wasn't for you, but for fans of the extreme Kingsman brand, stick around for the latter hour of the movie to get your wishes.The Acting
-Once again, I'll focus on the three actors with the most time and/or have the most build up, or else we'll be here all night.-Cavill is fine for the time he is on screen. He's got the sex appeal of the Pierce Brosnan spy, the delivery that works with the role, and yet the humor in the later portions of the movie. It's just too bad he isn't on screen enough to really blend it all together to the max (more on that later)
-Rockwell is Rockwell, fantastic at what he does and bringing his trade sarcasm with it. In this film, he's sarcastic, drops one-liners, just naturally humorous to me, and yet has that moment of vulnerability down that shows how talented he is.-But Howard surprised me with her props in this film, once more proving she can give more layered roles. She's nerdy, she's anxious, she's loving, and so much more, all brought together to make this odd situation believable, and often avoiding the annoying levels that this thing could have gone into.The Pace, Mostly
-And like most of the spy-action entries in this director's list, the pace is engaging for me given the balance of faster walking through the scenes, but slowing down to still smell the roses.-Argylle does its best to find the right ratio of storytelling, world building, and action, all to help further uncover the mystery of this writer's talents and the truth they are seeking.-And for much of the film, I admit they accomplished a lot and made the 2 hour and 17 minute run time feel better than I anticipated, and that is impressive in this day and age when you can complete a story in that time range.DISLIKES:The CGI Needs Work
-Some corners were cut in this film and one of them was the CGI of the film.-It is not the worst thing I've seen, but there are a lot of moments where the budget cuts and stretched graphics stood out and could be a tad annoying when not used right.-Whether this is during the action scenes, or sometime the backgrounds, Argylle's tech prowess needs some work to obtain the same prowess it did in the past and not get so blurred by the limitations of CGI.The Action Could Have Been Better
-Argylle keeps the action a little closer on the pulse of reality, forgoing the usual effects for much of the first part of the film and keeping it more of a straight shooter, brawler, with just a little twist.-Eventually we get to the roots, but for this limitation for me, the stunts just needed to be a little more spread out and hold that wow factor Vaughn's work is known to have.-Where were the over the top car stunts or off the wall blasts? Where was that pinnacle end fight that didn't feel so last minute and a stretch to fit another twist into the mix.-And though much of it does become balanced, I can't help but think there was still some more tweaking to be done to help find that balance the first Kingsman accomplished for me.A Few Too Many Twists?-I agree with the reviewers that perhaps Fuchs got a tad carried away with the number of twists in this movie.-Argylle is loaded to the nines with plots twists. Some of these are good, and others feel forced and added on at the end in some vain attempt to try and break a record.-They aren't all bad, but at some point, the amount of twists and surprises gets to the point of annoying for me and they could have cut a few things to help finessed the story and help on some of the other dislikes above.-Perhaps that straight and narrow could have gone a bit more to help achieve the same wow factor for ArgylleBalancing Of Actors Needs Improvement
--For me the biggest limitation is by far the balancing of the cast and the characters that get promoted in the commercial.-Rockwell and Howard have the most screen time, but after that, most of the rest of the cast is in these fleeting moments, with only Cavill eking out a few more moments.-True, they all have that memorable factor, but I know there was a lot more they could have done with them, more inclusion and bending the story around their involvement like the first part of the movie.-Samuel L Jackson, Cena, Dua Lipa, and more just felt like they got the shaft on this film, and though better than some movies, Argylle still shows what loading up on a cast can do if not balanced.The VERDICT:Argylle was a lot of fun for this reviewer, and was a lot better than the prequel a few years ago for the series. The primary reason is just Vaughn pulling his magic of blending so many things into an entertaining piece and finding the way to just make it energetic and fun. Some decent acting to deliver the lines, character development, escalating action and plenty of comedy all mesh well and optimize the feelings Vaughn knows how to make come alive. An engaging pace and just that entertainment value were all elements I loved and found worthy of the theater visit. Yet, it still has room to improve to get back to the first Kingsman for me. The action gradually gets to that exciting level, but feels a bit stiff to begin with as the move finds ground. The twists and pacing need a bit more sprucing up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair I know this director can bring. Yet, it's the CGI and the character integration that are the weakest elements, and no amount of catchy music and humor is going to offset that several key players were fairly absent. Still, I give this movie a solid go to and had fun with the theater experience, so I encourage others to get it a try at the theater if possible.My scores are:Action/Thriller: 7.5-8.0

"It's disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn's latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that's trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, ""So what's it going to be?"" There's also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we've already seen before in movies like ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it's true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there's a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there's the picture's excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. ""Argylle"" also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what's conveyed in the picture's video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn't nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. ""Argylle"" apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we'll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.",disappoint film intrigu premis fail deliv good end case director matthew vaughn latest actionadventurecomedi author spi novel bryce dalla howard stumbl reallif espionag scenario match plot latest novel embroil web evershift intrigu variou nefari parti problem film never quit latch onto dedic focu make pictur work comic bit inde quit funni frequent get bog meander stori line that tri follow convent twistladen thriller format leav viewer ask what go there also littl deriv materi thrown stori thread weve alreadi seen movi like romanc stone long kiss goodnight number jame bond flick true releas intend spoof titl especi scene featur henri cavil hilari hammi knockoff there big differ pay tribut play unrepent copycat there pictur excess length come bloat runtim far longer need fail attribut oftenneedlessli complic plot one begin tri audienc patienc time especi back half argyl also featur cute cuddli cat alfi central charact least trailer like narr overal film doesnt quit seem know supposedli friski fickl felin impress far differ what convey pictur video market shame titl potenti appar strength go fine soundtrack superbl choreograph action sequenc excel ensembl cast like sam rockwel bryan cranston catherin ohara ariana debos serious underus richard e grant mention fine turn howard cavil alterego one anoth one isnt nearli bad mani critic made could substanti better signific retool judici edit argyl appar ambit becom new franchis well see materi base kind box offic draw ultim produc point though think work cut

"I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie.

"An insanely big-budgeted movie, not very hyped, with pleasing to the eye photography, creatures!, romantic visual effects! And basically all you can do in a rosy-gray spy novel world.I would have liked to see more of Henry Cavill than Sam Rockwell, but it is what it is. A special note to Bryce Dallas Howard for bright acting in a dual role.

"Argylle is a disappointingly generic offering from Matthew Vaughn which does nothing to raise him out of the current slump he's in. Because up until now he's always been a master at taking familiar plot structures and using them to make a subversive take on tried and tested story tropes. He did this for superheroes in Kick Ass and for the spy genre in the first Kingsman movie. Argylle on the other hand barely has a single original idea in its entire runtime so it just doesn't feel like it's doing anything of substance with this fairly familiar story. It's not only totally uninspired as a viewing experience but also a pretty boring one at that.I don't know what happened to the Matthew Vaughn of old who used to be so good at telling concise, focused stories because this yet another film of his that felt massively overindulgent. Though that may be to light a word to describe just how poorly paced this movie is because almost every single scene in this thing overstays it's welcome. No matter how many great action scenes and funny moments there were, when you drag these moments on for too long they lose almost all of their effectiveness. The totally bog standard story doesn't do anything to justify the runtime it's given and Matthew Vaughan's serious lack of restraint in editing robs the entire film of any pace or urgency.I wouldn't really say I was that impressed in the writing or visual departments. It's a pretty bland looking movie overall with some impressive action but a massive overuse of CGI that frequently took me out of the film. There are many reasons my the 3rd act basically collapsed in on itself for me but the horrendous effects were a large part of it. It feels like ever since the first Kingsman, Vaughn has been trying to top the, now iconic, church fight scene to no avail. The last act dials of the insanity up to ridiculous levels and in no good way. Vaughn just throws a series of ludicrous, over-the-top action sequences in our face back-to-back and not only do they fall totally flat, they actually made me cringe.But like any film other film, Argylle lives and dies by it's script and quite frankly it's terrible. There's barely a single original idea in this entire film and the whole spy-story-within-a-spy-story gimmick was interesting to begin with but it wore out it's welcome pretty quickly for me. The whole plot revolves around a standard McGuffin chase, a shadowy rogue spy organisation and hints of an amnesia plot. We've seen all this 100 times before and it's not used in a way that feels cheekily referential but just frustratingly lazy. I had very little investment in the Cavill sequences since they're established as fictional from almost the very start but I also didn't find Cavill's performance or the character to be that interesting. He's written as such a charisma vacuum and that's not something I'd ever associate Cavill with. It felt like they just kept forcing the Argylle character into the narrative to capitalise on Cavill's star power rather than because the character warranted repeated inclusion. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell as a pair and they did have good chemistry but some of the twists and turns related to their characters I found to be quite ridiculous honestly and it felt like Vaughn was pulling twists out of thin air rather than truly earning them.I was truly hoping that Argylle would be the return to form for Matthew Vaughn that I've been waiting for but honestly this might just be the worst film he's ever made for me. I liked Golden Circle more than most but it was still a massive step down from the first, The King's Man on the other hand was a totally bland slog that never really justified it's own existence. But neither of those two films matched the level of wasted potential that Argylle exhibited for me. It just feels like Vaughn has totally lost sight of what made him and his films stand out in the first place and this feels like a bare template of a story without anything that makes it feel remotely original or subversive. I know it's only February but 2024 has already presented one of its biggest cinematic disappointments for me.",argyl disappointingli gener offer matthew vaughn noth rais current slump he he alway master take familiar plot structur use make subvers take tri test stori trope superhero kick as spi genr first kingsman movi argyl hand bare singl origin idea entir runtim doesnt feel like anyth substanc fairli familiar stori total uninspir view experi also pretti bore one thati dont know happen matthew vaughn old use good tell concis focus stori yet anoth film felt massiv overindulg though may light word describ poorli pace movi almost everi singl scene thing overstay welcom matter mani great action scene funni moment drag moment long lose almost effect total bog standard stori doesnt anyth justifi runtim given matthew vaughan seriou lack restraint edit rob entir film pace urgencyi wouldnt realli say impress write visual depart pretti bland look movi overal impress action massiv overus cgi frequent took film mani reason rd act basic collaps horrend effect larg part feel like ever sinc first kingsman vaughn tri top icon church fight scene avail last act dial insan ridicul level good way vaughn throw seri ludicr overthetop action sequenc face backtoback fall total flat actual made cringebut like film film argyl live die script quit frankli terribl there bare singl origin idea entir film whole spystorywithinaspystori gimmick interest begin wore welcom pretti quickli whole plot revolv around standard mcguffin chase shadowi rogu spi organis hint amnesia plot weve seen time use way feel cheekili referenti frustratingli lazi littl invest cavil sequenc sinc theyr establish fiction almost start also didnt find cavil perform charact interest he written charisma vacuum that someth id ever associ cavil felt like kept forc argyl charact narr capitalis cavil star power rather charact warrant repeat inclus like bryce dalla howard sam rockwel pair good chemistri twist turn relat charact found quit ridicul honestli felt like vaughn pull twist thin air rather truli earn themi truli hope argyl would return form matthew vaughn ive wait honestli might worst film he ever made like golden circl still massiv step first king man hand total bland slog never realli justifi exist neither two film match level wast potenti argyl exhibit feel like vaughn total lost sight made film stand first place feel like bare templat stori without anyth make feel remot origin subvers know februari alreadi present one biggest cinemat disappoint
"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel.",one worst movi ive ever seen would walk hadnt paid disappoint mani peopl im fan cant rememb laugh one time entir movi didnt see twist come movi even good nowher near enough come close save movi im john cena fan even close worst part movi there post credit scene came walk didnt even bother go back watch there way im watch sequel
"I really enjoyed this film and there was one moment in particular where I cried with laughter. It honestly brought me so much happiness. It's not a 'serious' film by any means but I loved the action, the twists and turns, the surprises, and let's not forget the cast. What a great cast it was. Everyone brought something different and it really worked! Matthew Vaughn is one of my favourite directors so naturally, I had to go and see this movie. I've also had Electric Energy on repeat since seeing the film and when it came on during one scene, I couldn't stop myself from dancing in my seat and was pleased to see others doing the same.

"Not usually one for ill-advised early predictions, I can't imagine there will be too many worse scenes sighted on the big screen for me in 2024 than the sight of a mis-cast and poorly CGI'd Bryce Dallas Howard skating across an oil slick in improvised knife skates taking on a room full of incompetent goons.Now we all know and understand that January and early February are earmarked year after year as a dumping ground for the films Hollywood has little faith in, projects that come and go with often little fuss and fanfare and often for good reason, but sometimes there really is no excuse.With this in mind, one would think that heading cautiously into Matthew Vaughn's new $100+ million dollar spy action comedy romp would prepare one to lower expectations significantly enough to find some type of enjoyment from this star-studded affair but unfortunately this newest outing from a director who once produced some of the more fun and energetic Hollywood vehicles is a wet blanket of a ride, providing a drab and DOA offering that's an early contender for 2024's worst Hollywood release.At a minimum 30-40 minutes too long for even the most forgiving of viewers, it's hard to fathom that the boorish and lifeless caper we are laying witness to here is from the same mind of the man that oversaw cult favourite Layer Cake, well-liked superhero flick Kick-Ass and the box office smash that was The Kingsman with Argylle sharing similar themes and concepts as those films but none of their charm, smarts or energy, all elements that appear desperate to make themselves apparent here but never coming to fruition.With a central concept that on paper could provide a fun, frantic and thrilling film, the idea of Dallas Howard's cat loving homebody writer Elly Conway getting caught up in the real world of spy's and espionage when Sam Rockwell's real life agent Aiden Wilde comes onto the scene has some serious cinematic potential and with the likes of Henry Cavill, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson and John Cena along for the ride it's not like Argylle lacks for talent in bringing Vaughn's vision to life but from early on Argylle gets caught in a rut it's never able to climb out of, that no matter the amount of ""twists"" or bizarre end credit sequences were going to be able to help it escape from.What makes the failings of Argylle to succeed, even to a minor degree of throwaway entertainment values, is the fact that this inept film wastes the talents of everyone involved too such a large degree.It becomes sad rather early on that we have to endure watching talents such as Dallas Howard and Rockwell lower themselves so here, with Dallas Howard the recipient of a terrible case of miscasting as Conway with her role morphing more and more into one that feels unsuited to her abilities while Rockwell's well-known and respected ability in comedic minded affairs is wasted on Wilde, a character who is anything like his namesakes surname with everyone else here barely raising a sweat with underwritten and underutilised characters that get lost in amongst all the so-called thrilling action that looks more at home in a mid-budget video game than a well-financed Apple original.Arriving in cinemas around the globe when the industry desperately needs some wins in what's going to be a mostly rough period following on from 2023's significant Hollywood strikes, Argylle is the exact type of original cinematic offering we didn't need and a reminder that a decent idea does not instantly a good movie make.Final Say -Loaded with talent, potential and a budget that should at the very minimum allow for some memorable spectacle, Argylle is a shockingly inept new release from a director that should know better, with Matthew Vaughn's turkey marking itself down as a strong early contender for 2024's most notable big budget failure.1 cat backpack out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",usual one illadvis earli predict cant imagin mani wors scene sight big screen sight miscast poorli cgid bryce dalla howard skate across oil slick improvis knife skate take room full incompet goonsnow know understand januari earli februari earmark year year dump ground film hollywood littl faith project come go often littl fuss fanfar often good reason sometim realli excusewith mind one would think head cautious matthew vaughn new million dollar spi action comedi romp would prepar one lower expect significantli enough find type enjoy starstud affair unfortun newest outing director produc fun energet hollywood vehicl wet blanket ride provid drab doa offer that earli contend worst hollywood releaseat minimum minut long even forgiv viewer hard fathom boorish lifeless caper lay wit mind man oversaw cult favourit layer cake welllik superhero flick kickass box offic smash kingsman argyl share similar theme concept film none charm smart energi element appear desper make appar never come fruitionwith central concept paper could provid fun frantic thrill film idea dalla howard cat love homebodi writer elli conway get caught real world spi espionag sam rockwel real life agent aiden wild come onto scene seriou cinemat potenti like henri cavil bryan cranston samuel l jackson john cena along ride like argyl lack talent bring vaughn vision life earli argyl get caught rut never abl climb matter amount twist bizarr end credit sequenc go abl help escap fromwhat make fail argyl succeed even minor degre throwaway entertain valu fact inept film wast talent everyon involv larg degreeit becom sad rather earli endur watch talent dalla howard rockwel lower dalla howard recipi terribl case miscast conway role morph one feel unsuit abil rockwel wellknown respect abil comed mind affair wast wild charact anyth like namesak surnam everyon el bare rais sweat underwritten underutilis charact get lost amongst socal thrill action look home midbudget video game wellfinanc appl originalarriv cinema around globe industri desper need win what go mostli rough period follow signific hollywood strike argyl exact type origin cinemat offer didnt need remind decent idea instantli good movi makefin say load talent potenti budget minimum allow memor spectacl argyl shockingli inept new releas director know better matthew vaughn turkey mark strong earli contend notabl big budget failur cat backpack jordan eddi movi guy
"Matthew Vaughn is one of my favorite directors. He has three movies that are on my all-time favorites list: Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. I love his style and consider him a master filmmaker.His last movie, The King's Man, was terrible. I gave it 2 stars. But no one is perfect and it's easy to forgive one misfire. But with Argylle, we have another severely disappointing entry. It's not nearly as bad as The King's Man, but that might be why it's even more disappointing. It could have been great.Why doesn't Argylle work? Movies are so complex, it's difficult to answer that question. Here are my guesses. First, the humor and attempts to be quirky feel off. I only laughed once. Second, there are a few cool action scenes, but nothing to write home about.Third, what idiot decided this should be PG-13? There are so many deaths, but they can't fully show it. So it feels neutered. They do this to sell more tickets, catering to the casuals. But my theater was nearly empty on opening night. So casuals didn't show up and you alienate your true fans. Fourth, for what amounts to a popcorn flick, I was fairly bored and unengaged.But I think one thing hurt the movie more than anything else. This is a great cast except for one role. The most important one. The main character. I don't dislike Bryce Dallas Howard. But this was a horrendous casting choice. I can list out 30 actresses that would have been better suited for the role. It doesn't seem too bad early on, but the further we get into the story, the worse it gets. It's not even a tiny bit believable.I still look forward to future Matthew Vaughn projects. But I just found out that his next movie is a sequel to The King's Man. Why?????

"This film would have been a hit if released in the 70s or 80s. Unfortunately, for the current audience, it falls short of expectations, especially for those anticipating a show akin to Kingsman.Positive:
Bryce performs admirably in her humorous role, and Rockwell delivers his part well. It's an enjoyable movie for a one-time watch, especially if you go in with no expectations or have nothing else to do. The best scene is in the beginning.Negative:
John Cena, Henry, and Samuel Jackson seem to be added to the movie solely for marketing purposes. While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie.",film would hit releas unfortun current audienc fall short expect especi anticip show akin kingsmanposit bryce perform admir humor role rockwel deliv part well enjoy movi onetim watch especi go expect noth el best scene beginningneg john cena henri samuel jackson seem ad movi sole market purpos movi start good pace slow significantli middl degrad last minut feel like end movi
"Argylle is a long, dumb, CGI-riddled mess. In other words, it's the standard modern day Hollywood movie. Some aspects are fun but the whole thing drags on and on until you'll be checking your watch every five minutes in hopes that it will be over soon. There is an abundance of CGI and a lot of it is terrible(especially the cat) and it makes the movie look fake but that's the norm these days. I'm not even sure if they filmed any scenes in London because the exterior shots looked really bad to me. Some of the hand to hand combat is pretty decent but for the most part I didn't care about what was happening at all. Additionally, some of the twists in this worked but overall it just kept doing more and more of them and became a convoluted wreck.Furthermore, the trailers and posters for this film straight up lie. They have you believe that Henry Cavill will be the star of the movie but he's in this for all of maybe five minutes at most. Those five minutes prove that he would be a great James Bond but I bet that will never happen because why make the correct choice and cast someone that is perfect for a role. Additionally, John Cena is in this for even less time and it makes me wonder why they even bothered casting him as he must've cost them a fair amount of money for what amounts to a cameo. The rest of the cast is fine and I like Sam Rockwell so it's nice to see him in a leading role. On the other hand, the comedy doesn't land at all and no one in my screening was laughing at any of the jokes. I think think the PG-13 rating hurts the movie by making it too tame and making it Rated R would've helped it a bit.. If this thing was made in the 90s it would've been much prettier, shorter, bloodier and most importantly, more fun. Argylle, however is just nonsensical, looks awful and overstays its welcome.",argyl long dumb cgiriddl mess word standard modern day hollywood movi aspect fun whole thing drag youll check watch everi five minut hope soon abund cgi lot terribleespeci cat make movi look fake that norm day im even sure film scene london exterior shot look realli bad hand hand combat pretti decent part didnt care happen addit twist work overal kept becam convolut wreckfurthermor trailer poster film straight lie believ henri cavil star movi he mayb five minut five minut prove would great jame bond bet never happen make correct choic cast someon perfect role addit john cena even le time make wonder even bother cast mustv cost fair amount money amount cameo rest cast fine like sam rockwel nice see lead role hand comedi doesnt land one screen laugh joke think think pg rate hurt movi make tame make rate r wouldv help bit thing made wouldv much prettier shorter bloodier importantli fun argyl howev nonsens look aw overstay welcom
"Argylle (2024) :
Movie Review :Argylle Review: Spy-action-comedy movies are rare, but that could be an advantage to many. In its first half, Argylle shows why this genre can be so entertaining and refreshing, and then the second half explains how terrible it can turn out to be and why it shouldn't be made often. There are too many twists, which is actually good, but after a while, it goes over the board, over the head, or whatever you want to call it. ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life,"" yells Aidan, aka Sam Rockwell, and you are like, ""Yes! Then why the hell do you want us to believe it?"" That's what happens with the entire second half of this movie as it goes from A to G to C to Z to T to again back to B. That's how MESSY it is. Too many twists make too much of a mess here.Argylle is about a spy novelist, Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has just finished her fifth book on a fictional agent, Argylle (Henry Cavill). For the next book, she decides to visit her mother, Ruth Conway (Catherine O'Hara), to brew some new ideas. On the train, she meets a real agent, Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who is on a mission to save her from a gang. Elly constantly imagines Argylle in place of Aidan while he is busy beating the gang and doing everything to save her. Aidan informs Elly that her novels are not fictional but are turning out to be true. She is a hell of a fortune teller, and that's why the bad gang is after her to get the hold of a certain master file before the good gang, aka Aidan, can get to it. But that's not even half of what you are about to see in the second half, so let's not spoil anything because there is a new twist every 10 minutes.The writing of Argylle sounds absurd in the first half, but it's damn funny. That's why you can carry on with it. The idea of merging a fictional agent with a real one and the events was somewhat interesting and was made watchable with a touch of comedy. The problem appears in the second half when you learn the truth about Elly, Aidan, and the gang members, including her parents. Every single theory starts annoying you, and then you get a horrible climax, full of mindless action and senseless ideas. From memory loss to brainwashing to even hypnotism, come on, man, that's just way above the line. That's too much. Argylle leaves you exhausted with the displeasure of watching 3-4 bad spy movies in that last hour. Can you imagine that?Bryce Dallas Howard as Elly Conway looks cute, but she has a deadly side to show too. Her punchlines don't come out as they should, but we can't think of any good female comedy statures after Barbie. The idea and standard have both changed now. Sam Rockwell impresses in some scenes and remains steady throughout the film. The handsome agent, Henry Cavill, is all what girls would make noise about. But the role? Let me change the subject. Bryan Cranston and Catherine O'Hara have a few surprises in store, but the performances aren't that good. Ariana DeBose, Dua Lipa, John Cena, and Samuel Jackson enjoy the screen time with their small supportive roles, while Sofia Boutella finds the best space amongst them. Alfie, aka Chip, the cat, will entertain you with her silence, but don't be surprised by her claws at the end.On the technical front, Argylle seemed okay, with some problems in the sound design. The cinematography was good, and the VFX work on those swipe-to-agents scenes was fantastic. You gotta give some credit to the screenplay writer for visualising those things on paper. It was a new experience, despite its stupidity. We aren't complaining about absurd humour here, and nobody minds that until it is making you laugh. Argylle fails to understand where to stop. You just can't expect us to believe every unreliable thing coming one after another for over a half hour. Matthew Vaughn's vision was too out of the line, too unimaginable, and unconvincing. He could have removed all those bunches of twists in the end and made a simple spy comedy, but he preferred to make it messy, and the results are not what spy movie lovers deserve. As a whole, Vaughan's attempt at over-novelization struggles to find the right ideas, so let's not open the book this time.RATING - 3/10*",argyl movi review argyl review spyactioncomedi movi rare could advantag mani first half argyl show genr entertain refresh second half explain terribl turn shouldnt made often mani twist actual good goe board head whatev want call that dumbest thing ive ever heard life yell aidan aka sam rockwel like ye hell want u believ that happen entir second half movi goe g c z back b that messi mani twist make much mess hereargyl spi novelist elli conway bryce dalla howard finish fifth book fiction agent argyl henri cavil next book decid visit mother ruth conway catherin ohara brew new idea train meet real agent aidan sam rockwel mission save gang elli constantli imagin argyl place aidan busi beat gang everyth save aidan inform elli novel fiction turn true hell fortun teller that bad gang get hold certain master file good gang aka aidan get that even half see second half let spoil anyth new twist everi minutesth write argyl sound absurd first half damn funni that carri idea merg fiction agent real one event somewhat interest made watchabl touch comedi problem appear second half learn truth elli aidan gang member includ parent everi singl theori start annoy get horribl climax full mindless action senseless idea memori loss brainwash even hypnot come man that way line that much argyl leav exhaust displeasur watch bad spi movi last hour imagin thatbryc dalla howard elli conway look cute deadli side show punchlin dont come cant think good femal comedi statur barbi idea standard chang sam rockwel impress scene remain steadi throughout film handsom agent henri cavil girl would make nois role let chang subject bryan cranston catherin ohara surpris store perform arent good ariana debos dua lipa john cena samuel jackson enjoy screen time small support role sofia boutella find best space amongst alfi aka chip cat entertain silenc dont surpris claw endon technic front argyl seem okay problem sound design cinematographi good vfx work swipetoag scene fantast gotta give credit screenplay writer visualis thing paper new experi despit stupid arent complain absurd humour nobodi mind make laugh argyl fail understand stop cant expect u believ everi unreli thing come one anoth half hour matthew vaughn vision line unimagin unconvinc could remov bunch twist end made simpl spi comedi prefer make messi result spi movi lover deserv whole vaughan attempt overnovel struggl find right idea let open book timer
"Matthew Vaughn has always been a director I have admired. Whether you are talking about his earlier works in Layer Cake or Stardust, or his over-the-top action films in Kick-Ass or The Kingsman films, I have never disliked his work until recently. It was not until 2021's The King's Man that I found his work to feel a little stale. That film didn't work for me on many levels, but I have either liked or loved the rest of his filmography otherwise. Well, you can put Argylle down as another one of his that I liked. There has been a lot of criticism, but I do not fully agree with it.This is going to be a difficult one to describe without sounding confusing, but I will give it a go. Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a novelist who has written a book series known as Argylle. What she does not realize is that the events of the book have actually happened in reality and continue to happen in real-time as she writes her next sequel. In comes Aidan Wilde (Sam Rockwell), a spy who shows up to protect Elly and takes her on a crazy adventure, avoiding a real-life spy organization out to get her. While this plot goes on, Elly sees visions of the main character in her book, Argylle (Henry Cavill), who helps her both keep and lose focus on her tasks. What I will say is that this film did not market itself well.Audiences see Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, and John Cena all over the posters and trailers, but in reality, they collectively have about 10-20 minutes of screen time in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long. Some viewers will be bothered by this so I thought I would mention it, but the fact is, I love both Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and I thoroughly enjoyed their chemistry together here, so I was easily able to forgive that. Where I will complain about the film though, is the fact that it tries to be too clever for its own good. Once something is revealed to the audience as a twist, another twist or two is layered within that twist, and then another few twists are just around the corner. It kept me on the edge of my seat and made it impossible to predict what was coming next (even though I kind of predicted the ending), which was nice, it was just too much all at once.Aside from the ridiculous amount of twists, this film (aside from the opening action sequences) has a fun story and quite a bit of action, especially in the last act. With that said though, as long as you are in for anything (as I was being a Matthew Vaughn fan), the last 30 minutes are just simply wild. Once the main plot twist occurs in the film, it becomes a completely different experience and it shifts gears into silliness, but because I like how Vaughn does silly, I was still in for the ride. I also liked the second Kingsman film, so I know this one won't be for everyone. Simply put, this film is too much, but it was too much of a bunch of things I enjoyed watching, so I can't be overly harsh here. In my opinion, Argylle is a good time and I recommend it, but be aware it gets pretty bonkers.",matthew vaughn alway director admir whether talk earlier work layer cake stardust overthetop action film kickass kingsman film never dislik work recent king man found work feel littl stale film didnt work mani level either like love rest filmographi otherwis well put argyl anoth one like lot critic fulli agre itthi go difficult one describ without sound confus give go elli conway bryce dalla howard novelist written book seri known argyl realiz event book actual happen realiti continu happen realtim write next sequel come aidan wild sam rockwel spi show protect elli take crazi adventur avoid reallif spi organ get plot goe elli see vision main charact book argyl henri cavil help keep lose focu task say film market wellaudi see henri cavil dua lipa john cena poster trailer realiti collect minut screen time film nearli two half hour long viewer bother thought would mention fact love sam rockwel bryce dalla howard thoroughli enjoy chemistri togeth easili abl forgiv complain film though fact tri clever good someth reveal audienc twist anoth twist two layer within twist anoth twist around corner kept edg seat made imposs predict come next even though kind predict end nice much onceasid ridicul amount twist film asid open action sequenc fun stori quit bit action especi last act said though long anyth matthew vaughn fan last minut simpli wild main plot twist occur film becom complet differ experi shift gear silli like vaughn silli still ride also like second kingsman film know one wont everyon simpli put film much much bunch thing enjoy watch cant overli harsh opinion argyl good time recommend awar get pretti bonker
"Matthew Vaughn is a filmmaker who is hit or miss as I enjoyed some of works on Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and Kingsman: The Secret Service. Argylle has a decent concept and a wonderful cast but unfortunately, this movie is a gigantic mess and might just be his worst movie.Throughout, the production, costumes and camerawork is okay but it feels cheap. The action and stunt moments are pretty solid as there are some decent strong action moments and thrills throughout. Most of the performances were just...fine. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sam Rockwell are doing solid performances but lack chemistry between each other and the rest of the cast members were mostly meh or not good performances. Henry Cavill is just Henry Cavill.Vaughn's direction was messy and the narrative is an interesting concept but it feels predictable and repetitive as it tries to add plot twists and other concepts together which makes it convoluted. Because of that, it made the characters uninteresting and some of the dramatic elements to be a bit boring.With good action and stunts, there are surprisingly some really awful CGI moments throughout. My god that CGI cat is horrendous. The dialogue is pretty rough, the humor and soundtrack is pretty bad, and honestly, this almost feels like something AI would make.I think it's safe to say Matthew Vaughn has kind of lost his touch on what makes his other works really entertaining.",matthew vaughn filmmak hit miss enjoy work layer cake kickass kingsman secret servic argyl decent concept wonder cast unfortun movi gigant mess might worst moviethroughout product costum camerawork okay feel cheap action stunt moment pretti solid decent strong action moment thrill throughout perform justfin bryce dalla howard sam rockwel solid perform lack chemistri rest cast member mostli meh good perform henri cavil henri cavillvaughn direct messi narr interest concept feel predict repetit tri add plot twist concept togeth make convolut made charact uninterest dramat element bit boringwith good action stunt surprisingli realli aw cgi moment throughout god cgi cat horrend dialogu pretti rough humor soundtrack pretti bad honestli almost feel like someth ai would makei think safe say matthew vaughn kind lost touch make work realli entertain
"Firstly ignore the critic's, they really need to chill out sometimes.. Argylle is a fun packed, totally silly movie. Just sit back, don't have preconceptions, and enjoy what is a entertaining film. Sam Rockwell partnership with Bryce Dallas Howard works brilliantly, creating some fabulous funny moments in the film. The whole cast interact their character roles brilliantly with each other creating a comic strip world that revolves around Kingsman narrative. Yes, you could make a case to criticise too much CGI or script isn't hitting the mark, but I want to watch a film and escape the depressing state of the world, I left the cinema having had a great laugh üòÉ",firstli ignor critic realli need chill sometim argyl fun pack total silli movi sit back dont preconcept enjoy entertain film sam rockwel partnership bryce dalla howard work brilliantli creat fabul funni moment film whole cast interact charact role brilliantli creat comic strip world revolv around kingsman narr ye could make case criticis much cgi script isnt hit mark want watch film escap depress state world left cinema great laugh
"My wife and I watched Argylle (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline revolves around a world-renowned author of spy novels facing a writer's block. She seeks to visit her mother to overcome her mental block, only to discover on her way there her books' are non-fictional and have an impact on reality. What other secrets about her abilities does she remain unaware of?Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass), the film stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), John Cena (Peacemaker), and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction).This movie is a complete disaster. It's been a long time since I've seen something this bad. Despite an outstanding cast, every actor is poorly utilized, with only Sam Rockwell's character being hit or miss. Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, and the addition of a cat, an awkward skating scene, and a nonsensical dance/smoke sequence contribute to the film's overall failure. The final fight is lackluster, and even the one worthwhile scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson's wine analogy falls flat. Henry Cavill and John Cena add nothing of value, and the film's only redeeming scene, the train sequence, was already shown in previews. The ending hints at an ""Argylle/Kingsman"" Apple+ TV series, but after this disappointment, who needs it?In conclusion, Argylle is a disaster for Apple+ TV, falling far short of the triumphant television series spinoff they hoped for.

"Oof, I was looking forward seeing the new film by Matthew Vaughn and didn't want to get spoiled by watching trailers or any promotion for this. Big mistake. I honestly don't know where to start. So I start with the question that came up at least fifteen times while watching this movie. ""What happened to action movies?""
I have never been so bored by an action movie in my life. If you like real explosions, real stunts, real car chases and real locations, this movie is not for you. Not only is everything CGI like any of the action films Netflix churns out by the week. The badly integrated green screens took me out of the movie. Every time. Now you might say we are talking about one or two sequences. But this is the whole movie. I could not immerse myself in the story that is wrapped in obvious fake sets the whole time. Even regular apartments look like they took stock photos and plastered the actors on top of them. And I'm not at the edge of my seat when I see a badly rendered car swerve weightless around the corner. Hell, even the cat is CG ninety-nine percent of the time. I saw this on regular IMAX but judging by the sheer amount of 'in your face shots' I got strong vibes that this is one of those movies that will get post-converted into 3D to make an extra buck. The schtick with cross-cutting Henry Cavill was wearing thin after a minute into the train sequence, but they kept doing it.I must say at least the story is rather ambitious: what starts off with the premise of a French comedy film (La Ch√®vre-1981) turns slowly into a weak 'The Long Kiss Goodnight' (1996) rip-off. But the constant misdirections where sometimes obvious and too much. And they tried too many times to go emotional and failed which brings us to the other elephant in the room: The actors.I don't want to talk too much about Bryce Dallas Howard, she is as wooden as in every movie role, no surprise here. She is a obviously corpulent, which I thought was a nice touch for the role of the book author in the beginning. It makes sense if she spent most of her days at home writing. But the minute we involve her into gravity-defying action acrobatics, it becomes laughable. Here was an opportunity to create conflict even comedy to show how rusty she is in the field, but I guess the makers weren't brave enough for that. Instead we get served more unbelievable action shenanigans, Bradley James Allan's choreography and creativity is sorely missed in Vaug's films. More unforgiving, is that a reliable actor like Sam Rockwell totally misses the mark with his smarmy and dry delivery. I don't know what he's going for, but likeable or interesting it isn't. He is worse here than in Seven Psychopaths (2012). Bryan Cranston is okay in this, he tries at least to chew the scenery, but even he is giving up by the end. Most of it is the fault of the writing, to be fair. Some of dialogues, especially the ones in the book club are so cringe worthy written, I really want to blame AI for this. Scenes meandering for far too long, everything is spelled out and hits the viewer with a jack hammer. We have an exciting scene with Sam Jackson watching a basketball game immediately followed by an upload bar (ripped off from his own Kingman film). I leave it at that.

"So if you are going into this, you have to know it's gonna be a little campy. Similar to The Kingsman, there are moments of heart, action, and absolute craziness.Some of the scenes were a bit much, but overall this was a fun, and Interesting movie. Some of the scenes were overly dramatic and we're similar to Deadpool's opening scenes as well.The twists in the story were definitely different, came one after another. All of the actors were on point, and I loved the switches from Argyle to Real life. The worst part was the CGI cat. And I don't think Samuel Jackson said MFer once.

"Is it a great movie? Not really. It's VERY good, and it's a lot of fun - possibly the most fun I've had watching a movie since...well, since The Kingsmen funnily enough. Another awesome Matthew Vaughn/MARV picture. A couple of the cast from that movie even popped up here - Samuel L Jackson playing a good guy, and Sofia Boutella playing a neutral party, where they both played villains in The Kingsmen - alongside the more prominent (on the poster, at least) names of Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara (who is ALWAYS a goddess on screen), and of course Sam Rockwell.A word of warning, though. If you're looking for a serious, gritty, dark actioner like some of the Bonds, or the Bourne franchise, or really ANY of the more-traditional spy movies, you're well out of luck. However, if you're looking for something that's gonna be a LOT of fun, with Matthew Vaughn's trademark visual style and fight scene flamboyance, then by Jove you're in luck, because that's exactly what this is.

"I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!",would absolut love soni meet absolut baffl thing like madam web get greenlitmadam web one worst superhero movi ever made terribl write charact action setpiec even act dakota johnson dull bore main lead probabl terribl scriptto fair movi interest concept final destin x termin thing howev poorli execut make morbiu look like dark knightanyway give amazon mom research spider right die cut
"Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!",look profil writer wrote madam web youll see virtual everi movi theyv written bad rate bad review hollywood continu hire writer big budget film could understand wrote movi asylum film movi terriblemadam web god aw difficult sit none main charact likeabl even villain lame seem like entir movi written set sequel would peopl spend money see sequel movi one worst movi ever written im shock bad movi sequel certainli wont bother watch itstop hire bad writer hollywood
"Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun.

"... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.",saw dakota johnson star natur cant lay entireti hot mess foot realli bad campi act happen part reminisc fifti shade grey movi star perhap director interest placement pepsi can perform digressbas movi play like cut scene budget xbox game ground thing feel design fail feel almost producersesqu approach everi aspect seemingli intent mangl yet one seem care come full circl go glori infin warloganth dark knight arriv way back batman robin catwoman level superhero flick bam pow gosh ye batmanhow movi make far actual releas one stop idea get green lit soni give million turn valuabl ip peopl wrote morbiu god egypt dracula untold last witch hunter get past write process script greenlit could one set point stop thing one edit room point bad look much mess wasbut suit art stori instead busi peopl commod cheaper recycl known quantiti practic nepot involv mayb le talent friend peopl youv work go find artist worthi stori dont care art dont care stori care make work financi regardless loss reput audienc wholeyoutub chri stuckmann deep dive topic big studio gener run folk came manag rather creativ rung write direct discus film take worth watch reason chri doesnt critic movi review sinc becom filmmak tell tone like complet displeas watch one id avoid
"This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10.",well guess movi soni univers im shock profitableth stori place basic madam web paramed develop power see futur current threat tri chang futur team power charact yet develop full potenti must shield chang futur protect themtri give littl stori get told away open vaguewhat like one two good scene didnt mind end realli like lot camera work cool look shot decent scorebut movi bad make morbiu look like batman act lack actor look bore feel script bad beyond silli line stori chop chang much neck hurt bad cgi bore actionand peopl harp dont like woman lead crap film enjoy marvel black widow decent movi regardless lead poorextrem disappoint
"Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.",horribl begin end open scene reek aw predict stori plot core know exactli happen even happen script suck dialogu even wors quit notic audio dub edit fact budget million budget matter amount money could save train wreck mention still make good film lower budget shazam first one budget delt lot side charact mile better godzilla minu one extrem low budget million dollar film effect product feel obvious cheap almost feel like watch long pilot episod cw tv showyou thought morbiu bad film bad bare minimum film doesnt even bare minimum goe beyond comprehens enter point origin ambit toward creat anyth isnt even singl superhero moment even horribl film like catwoman morbiu superhero moment action thing doesnt get instead vision futur potenti set sequelsthi movi also seriou problem product placement long commerci exact long pepsi commerci feel like pepsi stop halftim show could invest product placement film movi import superbowl lol top obvious place way much film calvin klein chase bank list goe movi call superhero product placement movieit bare even close cool moment see alreadi saw trailer she see futur think happen goe back moment realiz vision grant cool first coupl time get old real quick end get annoy abus way muchthat isnt redeem thing film act isnt even good would say side charact spider woman dakota find togeth potenti spark saw talent potenti fail big time horrid script spark never even spark like show match gasolin set firemadam mrbiu

"It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult.",worst movi superhero adapt ive watch recent year complet atroci effect atroci screenplay atroci act also big insult comic book reader know origin storylet describ movi simpli first fill hatr realli want cur entir creativ team unaccept filmal perform bad everyon there singl good actor tri everyon took role money terribl disgrac total eclips reasonth screenplay worst superhero screenplay ive ever seen bare resembl origin stori arent scene like spidergirl trailer includ there oblig instead write decent screenplay action scene full logic error theyv written without think complet garbageapart direct sorri say garbag scene shot taken straight phone camera action scene shown theyr hidden due atroci effect shamefulaft gener point soni urgent need cancel univers origin stori garbag there logic connect anywher theyr shot randomli dont like cur hope film sink box officeth last scene madam web gain power web effect cling soul unbeliev approv film may god punish youi dont know one talk atroc collect film whether woman go peru back second spiderman dodg firework danc boy tabl daughter left alon tell stori spiderhuman commun woman talk normal give birth end everyth disgrac hope univers sink get fire one involv manag film deserv job respect quit immediatelynot dakota johnson made statement say didnt watch movi serv complet garbag film your go watch life shouldnt money poverti tri watch differ cur audienc famili shame younot look budget movi anger grew even million dollar eighti million believ money realli cant believ noth disrespect disrespect audienc noth insult
"First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clich√©d, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.",first impressionth open madam web immers mystiqu ambit enhanc great music score yet movi progress becom mix bag rollercoast emotionsth positivemus score sound design standout featur madam web music score soundtrack enhanc emot depth film also succe creat moment genuin goosebump sound design realli enhanc impact care use sound pan bass revers effect creat sen tension immers one film strongest featuresth mixedvisu effect costum design visual effect madam web visual appeal costum design like casey red jacket three spider girl villain outfit stand particularli stun contribut film aesthet often shown film sinc film direct focu differ disappointedact direct although thought casey charact develop abil see world differ perspect great didnt like visual present way edit poorli done editor could use distinct color grade featur one see futur two see present momenthowev perform throughout film feel lacklust actor appear confus disengag combin direct fail maintain interest coher mani scene significantli undermin film potentialnegativescinematographi cinematographi bad sinc pictur dont show clear imag camera move fast cannot comprehend pictur kind recogn tri initi rapid event spider eye point view tasteless decis cinematographi someth like wow reason cinematographi lack heavili base medium closeup dutch tilt one hand uniqu choic hand hard watch found degre round camera rotat super cool expect vari distanc shot medium shot train scene cinematographi best filmedit pace edit arguabl weakest element madam web rapid cut disjoint flow detract significantli storytel lack coher make challeng audienc fulli engag narrativeplot overal execut storylin madam web clutter clichd suffer lack origin clear direct film ambit evid execut fall short creat compel narrativeth conclusionmadam web present paradox experi except music sound design stand sharpli contrast variou flaw edit cinematographi directionalthough visual emot stun moment frequent overshadow lack coher clarityalso think film would reason great incorpor tv seri would allow indepth explor charact plotnevertheless madam web bit mix bag moment potenti ultim leav viewer someth differ visuallyr
"Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels.",cannon disguisei firmli believ madam web go histori worst superhero movi also one worst movi ever made bad absolut fascin beholdnow ill honest went see heard unmitig disast seen believ truli disappoint massiv depend viewpointit take special kind director get cringeinduc perform fairli talent cast dakota johnson tahar rahim qualiti actor right script direct sj clarkson somehow manag wrangl absolut worst imagin everi singl person film ill surpris ever anoth featur thisnoth film work plot moron script seem like written teenag cinematographi horrend aforment embarrass perform audio edit baffl much dub brainmelt music choic im amaz didnt get shelv minut final cut doneto rate bad good wasnt bore watch peopl assum say plain bad entertainingli soif love watch hr car crash highli recommend aw mindboggl complex best possibl way film scholar historian analys movi year come hope talk vein room futurean absolut epic misfir level
"Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience.

"It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.",astonish think soni could put wors product morbiu boy madam web manag embarrass mess talent star wast probabl one worst comic book movi ever nobodi ask fill atroci dialogu awkward edit laughabl structur clunki poorlywritten messi sloppi movi pack mediocr edit performancesth concept interest paper couldnt save due terribl execut madam web simpli lack spark need nearli everi deptther simpli noth memor movi except mayb superhero costum doesnt redeem fact movi badso yeahmadam web yet anoth disappoint entri soni spiderless univers like love letter era superhero film peopl larg want forget pepsi add standout fall short could decent movi hand someon el twenti year ago
"Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.",madam web new spinoff set marvel spiderman world spinoff direct partli written produc j clarkson film direct tv seri episod superhero show jessica jone defenderscassandra webb dakota johnson work paramed new york learn accid superpow see futur possibl see live three girl threaten mysteri mask man spiderlik powersthi tri protect three girl must convinc live realli danger truli protect must ensur three listen learn work togetherth stori film interest concept final stori screenplay written five differ writer writer alway seem page stori sometim seem bit rush fray sometim seem didnt realli know exactli film studio despis screenplay also rewritten mani time cast member could longer alway follow exactli go suppos filmdespit messi rush aspect film remain familiar predict side superhero film make film seem bit longwind embarrass film reminisc superhero film came around year somewhat lesser qualityth visual effect dont alway look believ either blue screen cgi seen film cast member also first time actual work film visual effect fact littl experi film situat sometim reflect actingth poor script also give cast member opportun make someth special role dakota johnson also seem bit uncomfort promot film ignor properli promot film final film tri make best role tri add comedi role doesnt alway get chanc sydney sweeney isabela merc celest oconnor play three girl cassandra tri protect three given littl time give charact person unfortun enough make viewer realli care three better focus film might better use charact stori cassandra protect tahar rahim play villain film tri kill three girl also deal poor weak script result emerg strongli villain stori also didnt incorpor audio work well film lip sometim dont alway match charact sayingwith superhero spinoff film soni film studio make marvel current film seri messi soni disney marvel tri collabor film seri consult better plan want go film seri
"There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clich√©s but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like clich√© superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent.",noth good film badli written full clich full dialogu meant sound like clich superhero idiom yet butcher make sen noth costum parad player dead behind eye tell everybodi involv know go stinker theyd alreadi sign late would great flop made disney rethink output know actual ssu movi mcu movi head path fear take solut realli simpl need adjust hire polici includ person talent
"I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time.

"Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me.""

"LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying d√©j√† vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are clich√©, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0

"I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",im asham admit ive seen movi timei howev asham admit curio got better end almost entir empti cinema screen thank one toler movi buddi join trip local cinema partak describ one univers pan hollywood blockbust modern eranot interest watch anoth soni marvel outing last effort hear insan awesom aw madam web friend internet ident esteem critic made want wit potenti alltim cringefest peopl absolut right hyperbol around bad madam web im still tri comprehend could possibl testifi bad thing heredirect long time tv episod director j clarkson featur cast perform proven time capabl bring good madam web devoid talent may abl salvag type good offenc entir cinemat medium finish honestli unsur anyon could claim accept final version watch flaw exampl adr your ever go see product one thing couldv save nightmar fate creat itselfan experi could possibl come collect group gave fight save long shoot wrap madam web inexcus come penmanship guilti unleash morbiu u screenwrit matt sazama burk sharpless least manag find cult like good jare leto matt smith wildli ott charact bizarr action segment madam web noth two hour terribl plot charact spectacl intent quit liter valid reason movi exist form givenon atroci act hollywood film ever captur lead dakota johnson unabl hold back disdain film clearli hate part poor old tahar rahim take film unfortun mantl wig sydney sweeney madam web may promot type intens action thriller follow exploit johnson cassandra webb battl rahim ezekiel sim alongsid sweeney julia isabela merc anya celest oconnor matti get someth el entir hard come term withfrom detest frequent exampl product placement becom instantli icon viewer may find attempt crack open pepsi calvin klein view villain liter know noth zero attempt bother explain plan background embarrass use comic stapl charact arent even put action outsid dream sequenc script must sure conjur chatgpt madam web cesspool hollywood excrement isnt even funni horribl mere sad depressingth justifi reason madam web film stand soni deliber attempt sabotag marvel properti longer allow includ mani fan favourit arent fact zero excus madam web ever allow birth existencean irredeem amateurish embarrass exercis pointless madam web shockingli bad exampl blockbust filmmak exact type bottom feeder product cinema industri marvel brand didnt need particular point timefin say your glutton punish want remind everyth wouldnt wish see suppos piec big screen entertain madam web truli icon new addit stapl alltim misfir noth could prepar one garbag million dollar disasterpiec firework head jordan eddi movi guy
"I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film.

"Not nearly as bad as I expected from everything I've heard. Not great, but not terrible. I can see why there has been such widespread disdain of the movie, because the overall quality of it is mid (as the kids say today), and it may be even more insulting to the hardcore comic fans, but it had the basic pieces of an entertaining movie.I think what I liked most was how it grounded a mythological story, including a main character who learns she can see the future, while still being able to insert some heart into the center. And except maybe for the opening scene, the writing and acting were fairly decent. I even thought the pacing and direction of the story made sense.Yes, there were dozens of head-scratching moments about why certain characters made certain choices, particularly the villain, but not enough to tank the experience for me. I think this is the director's first major motion picture; I looked up S. J. Clarkson and she mostly has directed TV shows. I'm good with Sony Pictures giving people a chance, but I do sometimes wonder why they do it with origin story movies of beloved comic book characters. Seems risky.This was my first Dakota Johnson movie. I've heard her name a bunch but I hadn't seen anything with her in it prior to this role of Cassandra Webb. She was great the whole way through. Not until I looked her up after the movie did I know she was the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. The fact that I remember when those two got together, and that Dakota is currently 34 years old, means I'm old.The rest of the cast was fine. Again, I honestly don't think this movie was bad. If I had to rate it, then maybe a 5 out of 10? Perfectly average, and there's nothing wrong with that.And a bonus: Dakota Johnson looks great in jeans.",nearli bad expect everyth ive heard great terribl see widespread disdain movi overal qualiti mid kid say today may even insult hardcor comic fan basic piec entertain moviei think like ground mytholog stori includ main charact learn see futur still abl insert heart center except mayb open scene write act fairli decent even thought pace direct stori made sensey dozen headscratch moment certain charact made certain choic particularli villain enough tank experi think director first major motion pictur look j clarkson mostli direct tv show im good soni pictur give peopl chanc sometim wonder origin stori movi belov comic book charact seem riskythi first dakota johnson movi ive heard name bunch hadnt seen anyth prior role cassandra webb great whole way look movi know daughter melani griffith johnson fact rememb two got togeth dakota current year old mean im oldth rest cast fine honestli dont think movi bad rate mayb perfectli averag there noth wrong thatand bonu dakota johnson look great jean
"With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10.",marvel studio take respons involv spiderman soni decid tri build univers involv smaller charact lore venom morbiu get kraven hunter later year madam web saw film last night review madam web premis film see woman bestow power save girl kill villain foemain charact must honest never huge fan dakota johnson play cassandra web honest isnt particularli good overact everyth charact super unlik hard care clearli hamper aw write film cant rise give u lead role support care cassi web go one worst lead comic book film eversupport charact sydney sweeney isabela merc celest oconnor play three girl view villain pretti aw charact realli awkward particularli likeabl film tri forc like care charact come across poorli actress arent good enough make caretahar rahim play ezekiel sim one frustrat part film seen good actor charact potenti film realli flop make top villain stupid realli take filmadam scott ben parker probabl best person isnt realli given much still upset play ben parker realli clear done provid stupid fan servic actual annoy even morestori stori nonsens complet stupid plot make sen charact thing make sen cassi web particular one dumbest charact seen recent movi film also tri best ruin charact spiderman even though isnt film backdrop pretti dull horrend adventurescript realli aw written film thing make sen charact unlik humour mani plot hole crazi film noth interest allstyl mean guess action scene okay bad guy suit okay film film realli poorli edit look unfinish time actual quit jar watch way mani jump scare especi film horror film trailer show thing bare happen film feel like sold differ film never got madeoveral overal madam web truli disastr film one worst film ever seen worst comic book film time though glad saw film experi cost avoid garbag someth better hoursrat
"Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre.",liter zero expect went watch flick still thought someth good watch least one time marvel name movi low look like low budget cgi thriller comedi name superhero genrei mean start movi lost pace stori god know show interest screenplay plot even engag watch least minsi went dakota sydney screen presenc look good director loss opportun charact theyr play bad even proper dialogu given made common charact stori arc situat act ive never seen bad cinematographi film look like dont interest make film made spoof show make movi dont know say film badoveral bore fest spoof fo superhero genr
"Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10.",ok peopl come didnt like femal lead chestnut went one open mind expect describ review right film badth film see cassandra webb new york metropoli paramed begin demonstr sign clairvoy forc challeng revel past need safeguard young girl deadli adversari want destroyedi found film pretti bad disjoint clunki poorli pace feel awkward stiff charact personalityless look sound theyr recit line cue card almost robot might add script read like supermarket shop receiptth film stori place confus hard follow premonit sequenc main lead experi annoy creativ repetit point couldnt tell hallucin actual see seeingth film runtim overli long bad film gener hour roll eye film felt longer said long hour minut minut without credit pace jeez dont get startedth actor alright given script wise didnt work made come across flat there action bad effect that pretti much redeem featur flick sadli hasnt lot go pretti lack luster basicdont get wrong prefer film straight forward storylin plot follow one bit basic couldv use meati beef well emphasi keep audienc engag stori charact action etci gener didnt like film end pretti cringi like scene film well cringi action sequenc among good action gotoveral bad film got noth old chestnut man doesnt like film femal lead film bad plenti thing wrong peopl gener men woman boy girl didnt like flickth stori bland bore paper thin like charact lead littl bit good action effect seen overshadow aforement issu well issu like poor runtim pace lack engag film hasalso cant seem get head there plenti femal lead film past done well alien franchis hunger game along elektra tomb raider salt luci hanna etc could go that rant need call
"A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....

"By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it's quite a bit of fun. It's very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it's pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here's why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It's as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it's like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could've been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson's Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it's just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that's what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I'm sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I'm equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I'm kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer's latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It's a cool film to watch and it's aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it's just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out.",audienc realiz come jason statham lead action film beekeep latest film continu longrun legaci action flick quit bit fun far award nomine film zero expect cheesi pretti good take dive thing also pretti bad well cheesi film turn peopl abl ignor here recommend beekeep want watch new actionpack film enjoy think much aboutth beekeep organ hitman take crimin jason statham play adam clay retire organ manhunt everyon involv scam woman care led suicid simpl multipl bos compani like watch sophist video game play action sequenc wellchoreograph quit action scene overal film blast watch said dialogu begin end pretti atrociousif script rework think couldv surprisingli great film whole sadli dialogu full bee pun fall flat almost everi time even solid actor deliv charact arc dialogu josh hutcherson derek danforth main villain film laughabl realli good way whini selfentitl perform great like give charact dialogu suck line everyon say took experi mani time still lot great action that want movi like anyway im sure dialogu peopl hate movi im equal sure certain peopl find hilari im kind middleth beekeep david ayer latest directori effort alway great job action touch director alway welcom neon look film cool well cool film watch aesthet plea may rip apart script dialogu stori play nice nice resolut look fun action film film deliv despit downfal say check
"I seem to use that headline a lot. I guess it's better than a bad movie with bad fight scenes.Starting with the good, Statham is awesome as usual. And I loved all of the fight scenes. They are ridiculously fast yet completely clear. It's hard hitting, you can feel the blows. This is enhanced by the beastly IMAX speakers. And with the R-rating, it doesn't hold back. Although it's far from gratuitous.The bad? Sigh. The non-action scenes, which make up the majority of the movie, range from average to terrible. The quality level feels like a streaming movie, not a theatrical one. I spent much of the runtime uninterested and unengaged.Everything feels off. The dialogue is weird. The acting is questionable. And there are a bunch of dumb things that strain believability. Like the entire bad guy organization. Or a laugh-out-loud idiotic character decision during the climax. A true ""are you kidding me?"" moment.Even the cut to credits felt odd.

"Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland.

The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story.

"After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel.",fast x meg swore wouldnt wast time jason statham movi trailer beekeep look good thought would give one last chanc hope wouldnt get stung againthank action flick director david ayer sweet honey unpretenti overthetop glorious violent nonsens isnt taken serious film mani peopl star kill maim hr minut runtim answer lotstatham play adam clay beekeep way one look bee hive farm own kindli elois parker phylicia rashad he also retir special oper known beekeep part govern programm secret even fbi doesnt know elois lose save scammer commit suicid adam isnt happi man goe respons trail lead way presid unit state jemma redgravebuild blown limb broken bodi part sever peopl shot adam bare get scratch look realism look elsewher there even scene femal beekeep use minigun mount back truck minigun alway equal funat end day adam make bad guy pay crime promptli escap presum set bee hive villain shot earlier one prepar inevit sequel
"I was excited to see a new action movie with Jason Statham (one of my favorite ACTION actors) and although his figting scenes are still okay (ish), they weren't exhilirating. But there is something worse...The bad: Jason Statham (although in a leading role) doesnt get much screen time. A lot of the time we ONLY get to see a bunch of bland FBI agents, who arent impressing me in any way with their subpar acting performances.Nor do these FBI agents come across as credible by the way, constantly missing Jason Statham when they have all the time and opportunity to kill him point blank. Quite silly.More bad: the other supporting actors are really bad though, But they (AS WELL) do get a lot of screentime. So annoying.Not any good? Actor Jeremy Irons nails it. He plays the role of a cunning sophisticated bad guy and he is terrific. But what the heck is the distinguished and superb actor Jeremy Irons doing in such a cheap looking action movie?

"Not sure why i went to see this one as i've not seen most of Jason Stathams movies. And if they're anything like this one i won't be in a rush to revisit them.The movie looked dumb, and it is. Statham is a beekeeper. Both metaphorically and genuinely. Infact the worst part of the film isn't how repetitive and boring the action gets (where Statham is practically untouchable). But the cringey push to make ex-military beekeeper tough guys a thing. You'll definitely get some laughs from how ridiculous it all is. But half the time I couldn't really tell if they were intentional laughs or not.I guess there is enough decent action. Like the farm scene, the middle office attack, and there's a decent brutal fight scene near the end. But even the most promising part of the movie - setting up the great villian for a well deserved ass kicking later. Doesn't pay off.

"Written by Kurt Wimmer who is known for The Expendables which seems about right. Nearly all action which was ok, yet the story is just trash. If you're a fan of Jason then this one is just another average film with his stunts and fighting.Other than that the movie lacks any seriousness and the law enforcement roles are comical and everyone just comes out looking like keystone cops. It could have been so much better with a decent director and a lot of tweaks in the script.Sadly, not enough going on here to please anything but the Jason fans. 3 stars for action, zero for everything else.

"David Ayer's ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it's nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it's one man against all, you will love this, just like I did.

"A really enjoyable revenge action film full of fast paced action and corny bee-related dialogue. Although the character's backstory has been done many times before, the plot has some modern ideas and modern villains which are easy to hate and the strong moral message was quite refreshing. Good acting from a good cast of characters and whilst some of the henchmen are a bit silly, their larger than life presence adds some surprises into what is otherwise pretty standard fare.

"The Beekeeper attempts to copy the John Wick formula to the point of plagiarism.The setup is virtually the same. Statham, playing himself as usual, is retired and extremely dangerous ex-assassin, member of a secret group called ""Beekeepers"". He get pulled out of retirement over a seemingly minor incident, and the conflict escalates.A woman he sells honey to (played by the mom from the Cosby Show) commits suicide after having her savings stolen by a scammer company.He takes revenge for her, but oh no, the company belongs to the president's no-good son (similar to the Russian Mob boss's son in the John Wick original).He fights his way to the top through many neon-lit setpieces until he reaches the final boss. The end.However, unlike John Wick, there is none of the fascinating world building, none of the flair, none of the great music editing, much of the acting is awful, and so the whole thing comes apart at the seams. Tonally, the film never hits the mark. Scenes variate between overacted and ridiculous to boring, slow paced and TV series like. Every time the narrative switches to a female FBI agent, the air is sucked out of the movie, and energy comes to a grinding halt.The use of music is awful. It alternates between Batman knock off cello and contrabass strings, which don't fit at all, to house and electronic in scenes where it doesn't fit either. It worked in John Wick, because it was woven into the story. John Wick was either in a night club, or the music was played on the Assassin's radio station. Here it just comes out of nowhere.There are a few good kills. The car off the drawbridge early on is excellent. The final boss fight was decent, but not over the top enough to be memorable.Overall, this is a poorly made film that you will forget the moment you finish it.

"I mean, I don't know what to say; it feels like the movie's script was randomly written without any thought. The events are so poorly explained that I couldn't believe it while watching. I have no idea how they shot it. I'm addressing everyone who watched and gave good ratings: watch it again, life is not that simple.I want to mention Jason Statham. The only good thing in the movie is Jason. He is more than an actor; he's an excellent athlete, continuing this for years and elevating all the action scenes in every action movie. In some fight scenes in this film, extras stand there taking hits flatly, and it's entirely the fault of those who planned the scenes.There's no recognizable plot; the character just walks straight into the president of some made-up country's house, kills 30 people, and we watch this for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The FBI is portrayed as if it's a village organization; the detectives hang out like it's their dad's farm. It's unbelievable. They wrote a movie without sitting down and thinking about these details; it's astonishing.The Beekeeper program is constantly mentioned in the film, but what is it? What do these people do? How were they trained? What hardships did they endure? None of it is there; they just expect us to believe in a name. There's nothing about how the top-secret deadly agents of the government are trained.Money theft and the presidential race are portrayed like child's play. These are not people you can easily reach; to blow up a building or enter the president's mansion, you need an incredibly good script, and this film has none of that.The acting is also bad, except for Jason Statham. There's no good performance except him. The character's motivation is bad too; killing 100 people because a woman who treated him well while beekeeping shot herself. We should have seen a 3-5 minute segment about their intimacy.I don't know what else to say; it just goes on and on, complete bulls**t. I'm thinking about David Ayer's early works, and nowadays, each film he makes is dragging everything further down. The screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, has also messed up; he wrote it thoughtlessly. I'm eagerly anticipating the film's complete failure at the box office. Definitely a waste of time..",mean dont know say feel like movi script randomli written without thought event poorli explain couldnt believ watch idea shot im address everyon watch gave good rate watch life simplei want mention jason statham good thing movi jason actor he excel athlet continu year elev action scene everi action movi fight scene film extra stand take hit flatli entir fault plan scenesther recogniz plot charact walk straight presid madeup countri hous kill peopl watch hour minut fbi portray villag organ detect hang like dad farm unbeliev wrote movi without sit think detail astonishingth beekeep program constantli mention film peopl train hardship endur none expect u believ name there noth topsecret deadli agent govern trainedmoney theft presidenti race portray like child play peopl easili reach blow build enter presid mansion need incred good script film none thatth act also bad except jason statham there good perform except charact motiv bad kill peopl woman treat well beekeep shot seen minut segment intimacyi dont know el say goe complet bullst im think david ayer earli work nowaday film make drag everyth screenwrit kurt wimmer also mess wrote thoughtlessli im eagerli anticip film complet failur box offic definit wast time
"Jason Statham does the same movie - again - that he's been doing the last 20 years. This time without a script. They just stacked a number of fight and action scenes on top of each other, then called it a movie.Statham has done a few rather good movies like this. For example ""Homefront"". That movie had a script and good acting. But this... What is this? Is it made for teenage boys? For adults? For girls? Boys? I don't know, but the result is nothing new, nothing thrilling and nothing fun.So what do we got. Well, that's a really good question. The problem is that there's very, very hard to find a good answer.",jason statham movi he last year time without script stack number fight action scene top call moviestatham done rather good movi like exampl homefront movi script good act made teenag boy adult girl boy dont know result noth new noth thrill noth funso got well that realli good question problem there hard find good answer

"Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham's character is like a cardboard box, it's so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he's played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn't love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you'll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It's almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer's world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you'll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham's character, the beekeeper, doesn't want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you've seen but anywhere over that and it's just too dumb. Maybe when it's on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day.",looki love good action flick much anyon jason statham usual awesom sadli director david ayer deliv probabl one worst movi ayer made one great movi year ago train day also deliv good flick furi everyth el make horribl admit get kick dumb goofi movi laugh lot statham charact like cardboard box bore ye fight scene cool he play awesom charact also bit kick movi give u nothingphylicia rashad look fabul get minut screen time jeremi iron josh hutcherson great job talent wast movieth plot start realli promisingwho wouldnt love see reveng action movi evil call center get justic sadli premis wastedoh love hear word beekeep refer bee youll love thisth dialogu movi corni almost like satir action movi pointsin david ayer world noth work like actual real world goofi way portray everyth someth lot movi dumb fiction version everyth presid agenc classifi program work understand make movi sometim make everyth realli stupid entertain movi take cake instanc call center scam real thing mani youtub video show oper movi call center offic top clown spectacl youll ever see actual scam ludicr fiction version actual workth two main fbi agent portray goofi af dialogu nearli unbearablestatham charact beekeep doesnt want steal old peopl qualm murder feder law enforc offic cours movi without bat eyeso year old movi coolest thing youv seen anywher dumb mayb stream might fun watch make fun raini day
"This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the theater. I should've known better knowing I was going to see a Jason Statham movie. He has no talent, and he simply is known for his name and his action/fighting skills. But the reviews were so good! Apparently, the reviewers were paid off. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting skills were as bad as a high school drama club,. At times, I felt like I was watching ann episode of NOVA learning all sorts of things about bees. Statham has one facial expression in the movie, and it looks like boredom. Never again will I see on of his movie sin the theater... I'll wait to bore myself at home when it comes on streaming instead.",may one worst movi ive ever seen theater shouldv known better know go see jason statham movi talent simpli known name actionfight skill review good appar review paid plot ridicul act skill bad high school drama club time felt like watch ann episod nova learn sort thing bee statham one facial express movi look like boredom never see movi sin theater ill wait bore home come stream instead
"The Beekeeper isn't as tight or condensed as the films it borrows from thanks to an unexpectedly dense mythology but it really delivers where it counts. It's essentially Jason Statham beating people up for 100 minutes and it never gets old. Thankfully it doesn't really sequel bait however more of these would definitely be welcome.Jason Statham is never bad even when he's in a dud like a few of his recent films. Even so, it's nice to see his talent and physicality employed in something actually good. Jeremy Irons has the ability to deliver exposition about beekeeping in an engaging manner and Josh Hutcherson is actually awake for this one.Similarly to Statham, David Ayer has had a few misses so it's equally rewarding to see him back doing what he knows best whilst showing he and his team are really good at hand to hand combat. The score by David Sardy & Jared Michael Fry is a huge part of why this works, treating the dumbest twists with the utmost seriousness.",beekeep isnt tight condens film borrow thank unexpectedli den mytholog realli deliv count essenti jason statham beat peopl minut never get old thank doesnt realli sequel bait howev would definit welcomejason statham never bad even he dud like recent film even nice see talent physic employ someth actual good jeremi iron abil deliv exposit beekeep engag manner josh hutcherson actual awak onesimilarli statham david ayer miss equal reward see back know best whilst show team realli good hand hand combat score david sardi jare michael fri huge part work treat dumbest twist utmost serious
"The first film of the year may rank as one of the worst for the same as Jason Statham kicks butts & takes names (or is it the other way around?) in this goofy revenge tale. Statham, a former government operative, has retired plying his trade running an apiary on a retired woman's property, Phylicia Rashad, but after she commits suicide after being ripped off by some internet sharks prompting Statham to spew bad bee puns while he kills his way to the top (or bottom, these people are scum!) in a concern which runs right to the heights of the White House as the president's, Gemma Redgrave, (from Howard's End) son, played by Josh Hutcherson, is raking in millions from duped customers which will not stand as far as Statham is concerned. David Ayer, a mismatched director for this material (was Shane Black busy?), directs a particularly goofy premise from scenarist David Wimmer, does not help a whit w/humorless Statham doing the physical lifting w/o any issues but the unintentional guffaws generated from villains who look like extras from The Terminator's Tech-noir dance club scene makes this memorable outing for the wrong reasons. Also starring Oscar winner Jeremy Irons as Redgrave's handler, Oscar nominee Minnie Driver (wasted frankly!) as a government contact & Emmy Raver-Lampman (from The Umbrella Academy) who plays Rashad's daughter.",first film year may rank one worst jason statham kick butt take name way around goofi reveng tale statham former govern oper retir pli trade run apiari retir woman properti phylicia rashad commit suicid rip internet shark prompt statham spew bad bee pun kill way top bottom peopl scum concern run right height white hous presid gemma redgrav howard end son play josh hutcherson rake million dupe custom stand far statham concern david ayer mismatch director materi shane black busi direct particularli goofi premis scenarist david wimmer help whit whumorless statham physic lift wo issu unintent guffaw gener villain look like extra termin technoir danc club scene make memor outing wrong reason also star oscar winner jeremi iron redgrav handler oscar nomine minni driver wast frankli govern contact emmi raverlampman umbrella academi play rashad daughter
"I fell victim to a scam, and it's satisfying to see scammers getting their due in the Beekeeper movie. Jason Statham's action-packed destruction of the building and culprits is glorious. Despite the absurd plot, the theme of justice prevails. The constant investigation of Statham's crimes is annoying, and the movie's direction raises many questions. The initial 30 minutes were captivating, but the eventual disappointment left me perplexed. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the movie, even with its absurdities.Beekeeper seems like a John Wick movie - I acknowledge the similarities, but it's purely for entertainment, nothing beyond that!",fell victim scam satisfi see scammer get due beekeep movi jason statham actionpack destruct build culprit gloriou despit absurd plot theme justic prevail constant investig statham crime annoy movi direct rais mani question initi minut captiv eventu disappoint left perplex nonetheless still enjoy movi even absurditiesbeekeep seem like john wick movi acknowledg similar pure entertain noth beyond
"When you see the opening credits - Minnie Driver, Jeremy Irons and Phylicia Rashad - the possiblity exists that this could be worth watching. Ms Driver only had the 2 scenes so she didn't have to be paid as much to surrender her dignity to keep a straight face . Jeremy Irons had to work much harder.The target audience is presumably teenage boys who don't expect or need a script. I presume the 3 actors named above where offered ridiculous money to be part of this enterprise. They are the comprobable film to the Hallmark Christmas movie (with everything pretty much similar to the cookie cutter used for all the previous examples )Presumably they had X number of required explosions , Y in the stunt crew, calculated Z as the number of scenes with a few gaps for words (lets not call it a script)The industry needs these kind of 'Expendeble' wholy forgettable flic to fill in.I only went to see this because I had a free ticket and if I had actually PAID money to see this, I'd likely be angry at my choice or disappointed.There are lots of better old films from the 30s, 40s, 50 etc .

"Adam Clay on the surface is a calm character, a man who keeps brees, but underneath he's part of a network of powerful, dangerous killers known as Beekeepers. One day a friend of his is taken by scammers, he vows to take revenge.Once again, I find myself thoroughly entertained and very satisfied by one of Jason Statham's high octane, action films.It's way over the top, and some of the dialogue is beyond abysmal, so corny, but the core essence is rather emotive, who hasn't been annoyed recently, hearing of some elderly person being scammed out of their life savings.Some of the talk about bees is honestly cringe worthy, but that's the charm of the film, it's not trying to take itself too seriously.Lots of great action scenes, very well staged, and Statham is just so cool.On the debit side, Agent Parker isn't a particularly good character, and some of the American accents are a little dodgy, Jemma Redgrave's in particular is a little dodgy.I really did enjoy it.7/10.",adam clay surfac calm charact man keep bree underneath he part network power danger killer known beekeep one day friend taken scammer vow take revengeonc find thoroughli entertain satisfi one jason statham high octan action filmsit way top dialogu beyond abysm corni core essenc rather emot hasnt annoy recent hear elderli person scam life savingssom talk bee honestli cring worthi that charm film tri take seriouslylot great action scene well stage statham coolon debit side agent parker isnt particularli good charact american accent littl dodgi jemma redgrav particular littl dodgyi realli enjoy
"The Beekeeper is one of those dumb stupid action movies that are so ridiculously dumb, yet still has some strong parts. Director David Ayer isn't a filmmaker I really like but I have enjoyed a few of his works like Training Day and End of Watch. His previous movie The Tax Collector was absolutely atrocious but The Beekeeper is slightly better than his last movie.Many of the action thrills, stunts, moments and scenes were ridiculous but for the most part, well-executed and shot pretty well. Although with some mix of poor editing and bad uses of CGI. All the performances were okay as Jason Statham still plays himself but still the fun aspect of the movie. The narrative is pretty ridiculous and kind of dumb where the more you think about it, the more dumber it becomes. The style definitely takes a bit too much influence on the John Wick series and some of the dialogue is quite laughable. But hey, all in all, I did enjoy some moments because it clearly doesn't take itself too seriously and the actions, thrills and Statham being himself was pretty fun.",beekeep one dumb stupid action movi ridicul dumb yet still strong part director david ayer isnt filmmak realli like enjoy work like train day end watch previou movi tax collector absolut atroci beekeep slightli better last moviemani action thrill stunt moment scene ridicul part wellexecut shot pretti well although mix poor edit bad use cgi perform okay jason statham still play still fun aspect movi narr pretti ridicul kind dumb think dumber becom style definit take bit much influenc john wick seri dialogu quit laughabl hey enjoy moment clearli doesnt take serious action thrill statham pretti fun
"There is so much to like about this movie.It's got Minnie Driver in it. She's been driving a path to my heart for, yikes, thirty years now.Josh Hutcherson is a villain. And a darn good one.He's likable, funny, stupid and despicable all at once and it is lovely to see.He takes full advantage of his role and the audience in full reaps the benefits.This movie has cinematic testosterone with a capital T squeezed right from the glorious 1980's and butt-kicking with a capital B.They pair together rather nicely as they often do.The kills are plenty and plenty creative.Director David Ayer doing what he always does best.And Jeremy Irons stepping in and classing up the joint.This is a most welcome original theatrical release for January.It's not a comic book movie or a Star Wars movie.It's not a reboot, sequel or prequel.It's Jason Statham doing Jason Statham things.And it is a blast to watch on the big screen.I also highly recommend another Beekeeper film, Ulee's Gold (1997) starring Peter Fonda. It too, is quite buzz worthy.",much like movieit got minni driver she drive path heart yike thirti year nowjosh hutcherson villain darn good oneh likabl funni stupid despic love seeh take full advantag role audienc full reap benefitsthi movi cinemat testosteron capit squeez right gloriou buttkick capit bthey pair togeth rather nice often doth kill plenti plenti creativedirector david ayer alway bestand jeremi iron step class jointthi welcom origin theatric releas januaryit comic book movi star war movieit reboot sequel prequelit jason statham jason statham thingsand blast watch big screeni also highli recommend anoth beekeep film ule gold star peter fonda quit buzz worthi
